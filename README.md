## About this Repo
This repository contains the files for the ROSA system conversion software application. Since we're still working on characterization, I have included a spreadsheet of placeholder data to use to experiment with Scipy's imputation tools. 

I have built the application using wxPython for the frontend and Scipy, Numpy, and Pandas for the backend. I may bring more libraries in as needed in the future.

## Roadmap:
1. For now, I am focusing on getting the front- and backends working properly
2. Cleaning up and streamlining the code
3. Overhauling toolbar implementation; adding support for several different conversions
4. Redesigning the frontend to use a grid sizer and more sophisticated colors and visual elements, including logo
5. Packaging the program into an executable
6. Adding final table of values from characterization experiments

## More updates to follow!

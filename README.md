## About this Repo
This repository contains the files for the ROSA project's conversion software. Our final goal is for this to be a simple, elegant, and lightweight desktop application that can be used by clinicians as a companion to our physical measurement system.

Since we're still working on characterization, I have included a spreadsheet of placeholder data to use to experiment with Scipy's imputation tools. I will be replacing this with the real data once it becomes available (see roadmap).

## Libraries:
- *Frontend:* wxPython
- *Backend:* Scipy, Numpy, Pandas (more may be added as needed)

## Roadmap:
1. For now, I am focusing on getting the front- and backends working properly
2. Cleaning up and streamlining the code
3. Overhauling toolbar implementation; adding support for several different conversions
4. Redesigning the frontend to use a grid sizer and more sophisticated colors and visual elements, including logo
5. Packaging the program into an executable
6. Adding final table of values from characterization experiments

## More updates to follow!
